    "\n",
    "To get the most out of these guides, work through them in numeric order (as shown on the left pane) remembering to scroll all the way through each (some will be quite long) running code and reading the guidence at your own pace.\n",

    "\"Jupyter lab\" is just the term for the interactive browser-based python interpreter you are currently using.\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"Jupyer notebook\" is just single one of the cell-like python interpreter documents found in a lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "To put it another way - you're currently reading a jupyter notebook (START HERE.ipnb), the display to the left are the included controls are part of the \"lab\" interface wrapping that notebook, i.e we use notebooks - those notebooks go \"in\" a lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some things to note:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A jupyter notebook (files ending .ipynb - like the one you're currently reading) are made up of 'cells'.\n",
    "* These cells can either containt Markdown (styled text - like this one that you're reading) or executable pyhon code.\n",
    "* Each `cell` of python code can be run individually.\n",
    "* The output from any code cell run will be shown below that cell.\n",
    "* If you end a cell with a variable, that variable will get printed as output, even without a print() command. See the example cell below"
