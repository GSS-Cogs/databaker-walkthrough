    "This is an alternative method of tweaking the value of dimension cells, that can be used prior to post processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason to use this is simple - altering the value before the flatening process occurrs means you're modifying one value, as opposed to the countless repeats of that value that will be present during a typical post processing stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `cellValueOverride` consists of a single dictionary that can be passed into a dimension while it is being defined.\n",
