    "As the project advanced the means of sourcing data will also evolve. Though both **scrapers** and data pre-canned in **online buckets** are certain to be parts of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of these tutorials we'll pretend the data is being acquired via scrapers. For each example a prebuilt mock scraper (a thing that'll just give you the data) will be included as the starting point. In practice the scraper and/or acquisition-method for a given dataset developed as part of the dataset onboarding process.\n",

    "One key point to be aware of when we talk about source data, is that whatever \"the\" source is, it will include both data and metadata, as for our purposes a data source without metadata is effectively useless.\n"
